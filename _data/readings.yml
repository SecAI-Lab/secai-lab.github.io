  discussion: "Since the recent advent of regulations for data protection
(e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation), there has been
increasing demand in deleting information learned from sensitive data in pre-trained models without retraining from
scratch. The inherent vulnerability of neural networks towards adversarial attacks and unfairness also calls for a robust
method to remove or correct information in an instance-wise
fashion, while retaining the predictive performance across
remaining data. To this end, we consider instance-wise unlearning, of which the goal is to delete information on a set
of instances from a pre-trained model, by either misclassifying each instance away from its original prediction or relabeling the instance to a different label. We also propose
two methods that reduce forgetting on the remaining data:
1) utilizing adversarial examples to overcome forgetting at
the representation-level and 2) leveraging weight importance
metrics to pinpoint network parameters guilty of propagating
unwanted information. Both methods only require the pretrained model and data instances to forget, allowing painless
application to real-life settings where the entire training set
is unavailable. Through extensive experimentation on various
image classification benchmarks, we show that our approach
effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning given instances in both single-task and continual unlearning scenarios."

The paper utilizes adversarial examples to retain the original decision boundary during unlearning. This approach 
is intriguing yet it raises questions as to what it means to “forget” a data point. The paper states that 
misclassification signifies forgetting yet “Right to be Forgotten” seems to imply the removal of a 
certain training data.
