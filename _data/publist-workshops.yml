- title: "On the Learnability, Robustness, and Adaptability of Deep Learning Models for Obfuscation-applied Code"
  image: 
  description: "Code obfuscation is a common technique to impede software analysis on purpose by concealing a program’s structure, logic, or behavior for both benign and malicious purposes. Its widespread adoption poses a significant challenge to security analysts. While deep learning has shown promise across various binary analysis tasks, the learnability and the applicability from obfuscation-applied code have received less attention to date. Prior work often overlooks code obfuscation or defers it to future research, as the complexity of obfuscation may differ significantly depending on the design and implementation differences across obfuscation tools. In this paper, we investigate how well obfuscation-applied code can be learned on a state-of-the-art model for the binary code similarity detection task. Training the model with obfuscated codes from two source-based and IR-based obfuscation tools (e.g., Tigress, Obfuscator-LLVM), we evaluate: i) learnability on obfuscated code, ii) generalizability for both obfuscated and non-obfuscated code, iii) robustness to known obfuscation techniques, and iv) adaptability to unknown obfuscation techniques. Our findings show that learning a task directly from obfuscated code is feasible, outperforming models trained on large volumes of non-obfuscated code even with a comparatively small dataset. However, achieving generalizability across obfuscated and non-obfuscated code remains challenging. Furthermore, we find that the model’s robustness and adaptability to previously (un)known obfuscations is closely tied to the inherent complexity of an obfuscation technique."

- title: "Semantic-aware Binary Code Representation with BERT"
  image:
  description: A wide range of binary analysis applications, such as bug discovery, malware analysis and code clone detection, require recovery of contextual meanings on a binary code. Recently, binary analysis techniques based on machine learning have been proposed to automatically reconstruct the code representation of a binary instead of manually crafting specifics of the analysis algorithm. However, the existing approaches utilizing machine learning are still specialized to solve one domain of problems, rendering recreation of models for different types of binary analysis. In this paper, we propose DeepSemantic utilizing BERT in producing the semantic-aware code representation of a binary code. To this end, we introduce well-balanced instruction normalization that holds rich information for each of instructions yet minimizing an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. DeepSemantic has been carefully designed based on our study with large swaths of binaries. Besides, DeepSemantic leverages the essence of the BERT architecture into re-purposing a pre-trained generic model that is readily available as a one-time processing, followed by quickly applying specific downstream tasks with a fine-tuning process. We demonstrate DeepSemantic with two downstream tasks, namely, binary similarity comparison and compiler provenance (i.e., compiler and optimization level) prediction. Our experimental results show that the binary similarity model outperforms two state-of-the-art binary similarity tools, DeepBinDiff and SAFE, 49.84% and 15.83% on average, respectively.

- title: "Configuration-Driven Software Debloating"
  image:
  description: With legitimate code becoming an attack surface due to the proliferation of code reuse attacks, software debloating is an effective mitigation that reduces the amount of instruction sequences that may be useful for an attacker, in addition to eliminating potentially exploitable bugs in the removed code. Existing debloating approaches either statically remove code that is guaranteed to not run (e.g., non-imported functions from shared libraries), or rely on profiling with realistic workloads to pinpoint and keep only the subset of code that was executed. In this work, we explore an alternative configuration-driven software debloating approach that removes feature-specific code that is exclusively needed only when certain configuration directives are specified—which are often disabled by default. Using a semi-automated approach, our technique identifies libraries solely needed for the implementation of a particular functionality and maps them to certain configuration directives. Based on this mapping, feature-specific libraries are not loaded at all if their corresponding directives are disabled. The results of our experimental evaluation with Nginx, VSFTPD, and OpenSSH show that using the default configuration in each case, configuration-driven debloating can remove 77% of the code for Nginx, 53% for VSFTPD, and 20% for OpenSSH, which represent a significant attack surface reduction.

  description: The Internet’s importance in promoting free and open communication has led to widespread crackdowns on its use in countries around the world. In this study, we investigate the relationship between national policies around freedom of speech and Internet topology in various countries. We combine techniques from network measurement and machine learning to identify features of Internet structure at the national level that are the best indicators of a country’s level of freedom. We find that IP density and path lengths to other countries are the best indicators of a country’s freedom. We also find that our methods predict the freedom category (Free/Partly Free/Not Free) of a country with 95% accuracy.
