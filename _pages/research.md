## Research

Here are ongoing research projects.

**Semantic-aware Executable Binary Code Representation and its Applications with BERT.** 
The project seeks a better binary code representation in an executable binary
that can deduce the underlying code semantics with one of state-of-the-art
architectures, BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers). 
Further, we attempt to apply the representation to other applications
that require the inference of code semantics.
Supported by NRF (National Research Foundation of Korea).

**Autonomous Car Security as part of Advance Research and Development for Next-generation Security.**
It aims to discover a vulnerability (e.g., sequence of malicious messages)
against a car infortainment system, and to develop an AI-based intrusion detection system.
Supported by IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).


### Past Projects

**Vulnerability Analysis on IoTivity Protocol Provisioning.** 
The goal of the project is to analyze the IoTivity protocol,
an open source software framework for seemless communications
between the Internet of Things as an implementation 
of OSF (Open Software Framework), followed by discovering
a weakness of the protocol while onboarding and provisioning.
Supported by NSRI (National Security Research Institute).
