## Research

Here are ongoing research projects.

**A Study of Metric to Measure the Quality of Decompiled Codes**
The project studies a metric (means) to evaluate quality of
decompiled codes from varying decompilers such as Hex-Rays Decompiler.
It encompasses an existing methodology for code quality measurement, comparison
between an original source and a decompiled code, and tool
development for measuring code quality.
Supported by NSRI (National Security Research Institute).
*This is a joint project with [Sungjae Hwang](https://softsec-lab.github.io/)
at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).*

**Efficient Fuzzing for Internal Communication Protocols with Firmware of Unmanned Vehicles**
The objective of the project is to discover a vulnerability against 
a protocol for internal communications in a Drone system (i.e., firmware binary).
In particular, we look into protocols like uORB and FastRTPS in PX4,
followed by investigating efficient fuzzing techniques that focus on a target protocol.
*This is a joint project with [Daehee Jang](https://daehee87.github.io/)
at Sungshin Women's University.*

**Semantic-aware Executable Binary Code Representation and its Applications with BERT.** 
The project seeks a better binary code representation in an executable binary
that can deduce the underlying code semantics with one of state-of-the-art
architectures, BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers). 
Further, we attempt to apply the representation to other applications
that require the inference of code semantics.
Supported by NRF (National Research Foundation of Korea).


### Past Projects

**Autonomous Car Security as part of Advance Research and Development for Next-generation Security.**
It aims to discover a vulnerability (e.g., sequence of malicious messages)
against a car infortainment system, and to develop an AI-based intrusion detection system.
Supported by IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).
*This is a joint project with 
[Yuseok Jeon](https://ysjeon.net/) at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), 
[Haehyun Cho](https://haehyun.github.io/) at Soongsil University, and
[Dokyung Song](https://cysec.yonsei.ac.kr/~dokyungs/) at Yonsei University.*

**Vulnerability Analysis on IoTivity Protocol Provisioning.** 
The goal of the project is to analyze the IoTivity protocol,
an open source software framework for seemless communications
between the Internet of Things as an implementation 
of OSF (Open Software Framework), followed by discovering
a weakness of the protocol while onboarding and provisioning.
Supported by NSRI (National Security Research Institute).
*This is a joint project with
[Hyongkee Choi](https://sites.google.com/g.skku.edu/meoseriful/), and
[Jaehoon Paul Jeong](http://iotlab.skku.edu/)*
