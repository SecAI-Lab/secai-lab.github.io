We are a [security research group](https://github.com/SecAI-Lab) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cs.skku.edu/en), 
College of Computing and Informatics in [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu). 

The number of computing devices such as laptops, workstations, mobiles, Internet of Things, and cloud services has been ever increasing, communicating with each other. Accordingly, enormous amount of digitalized data become available, necessitating information security all around us.

The SecAI lab focuses on system/software security and emerging technologies that require security. In particular, we are working on security with artificial intelligence (AI) where our lab name originates from. Our interests encompass varying topics to which deep learning could be applied including - but not limited to - executable binary analysis (e.g., benign software and malware), understanding of code semantics, advanced attack detection and prevention, digital forensics, etc.

I am Hyungjoon Koo who leads the SecAI lab. Launching a new lab, a relatively young lab means that we have lots of potential for the future.

**We are looking for a passionate Ph.D. student (Preferred fields: binary analysis with AI, privacy) to join our lab!**
